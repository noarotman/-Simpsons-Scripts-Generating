# Simpsons-Scripts-Generating
In this project I built a recurrent neural network (RNN), using Tensorflow, to generate Simpsons TV scripts for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

I've completed a jupyter notebook as a part of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.
In this project, I generated Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I used a part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons.
The Neural Network will generates a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

Please note: It's ok if the TV script doesn't make any sense if you training the model with the given data set, 
since the training was on less than a megabyte of text.
In order to get good results, you'll have to use a smaller vocabulary or get more data.
